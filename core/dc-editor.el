;;; Code:

;; Death to the tabs!  However, tabs historically indent to the next
;; 8-character offset; specifying anything else will cause *mass*
;; confusion, as it will change the appearance of every existing file.
;; In some cases (python), even worse -- it will change the semantics
;; (meaning) of the program.
;;
;; Emacs modes typically provide a standard means to change the
;; indentation width -- eg. c-basic-offset: use that to adjust your
;; personal indentation width, while maintaining the style (and
;; meaning) of any files you load.
